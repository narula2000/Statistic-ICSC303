We can assume that the attitudes of Duke students in the sample are independent of each other, and attitudes of US residents in the sample are independent of each other as well.

\pause

\item Therefore, we need to first find a common (\hl{pooled}) proportion for the two groups, and use that in our analysis.

\pause

\item This simply means finding the proportion of total successes among the total number of observations.

\begin{itemize}

\item for CI: use $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$
\item for HT:
